This tarball was created 12-May-2020 and contains a data-only
update to sched. This was motivated by the publication of
GSFC 2019d data for antenna locations.

There are only extremely minor mods to the code itsel (e.g., version number
change, warning message about the antenna location mods, etc.).  Users should
not see any changes to their output except for those caused by the geodetic
database modifications.
