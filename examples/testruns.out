    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:  11.40  Release 11.4.  March 14, 2015
 
The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog
 
Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).
 
SHORTN: WARNING - Source names longer than 8 characters used.
        This will be a problem if geodetic software (SOLV etc) is used.
        This might be a problem on some correlators.
TWOHDSET: Using 64 track mode for wide bandwidth.
TWOHDSET:  Using 16 Mbps per track record rate.  Mark IV format on disk only.
CHKSCN:    41 scans had more than half the antennas arrive on-source after the start time.
              This could be normal if using duration scheduling with small gaps.
SUMOPE:  Writing summary file eg1024.sum
STALST:  WARNING - A station has zero axis offset, which is unlikely.
         Accurate positions, including axis offsets are needed for correlation.
         Is your station location information adequate?
         See the summary file station list to see which stations are suspect.

    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:  11.40  Release 11.4.  March 14, 2015
 
The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog
 
Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).
 
CHKSCN:   528 scans had more than half the antennas arrive on-source after the start time.
              This could be normal if using duration scheduling with small gaps.
SUMOPE:  Writing summary file eg24.sum
 
SCHED: --- DOSCANS given to restrict output to scans   169 to   456 ---
       --- This affects the .vex, .oms, crd., sch., and .flag files ---

    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:  11.40  Release 11.4.  March 14, 2015
 
The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog
 
Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).
 
SHORTN: WARNING - Source names longer than 8 characters used.
        This will be a problem if geodetic software (SOLV etc) is used.
        This might be a problem on some correlators.
CHKSCN:     2 scans had more than half the antennas arrive on-source after the start time.
              This could be normal if using duration scheduling with small gaps.

SHORTN: WARNING - Source names longer than 8 characters used.
        This will be a problem if geodetic software (SOLV etc) is used.
        This might be a problem on some correlators.
CHKSCN:    51 scans had more than half the antennas arrive on-source after the start time.

STALST:  WARNING - A station has zero axis offset, which is unlikely.
         Accurate positions, including axis offsets are needed for correlation.
         Is your station location information adequate?

VXSCH: TORUN    has    18 Tsys measurements. Maximum interval =   44 minutes.
VXSCH: Tsys calibration at most MkIV stations is taken during every gap in recording,
       but these appear over 15 min apart for the stations listed above!
       This can be improved by inserting gaps at regular intervals.
       Note this is not an issue for  Westerbork or Arecibo
VXSCH: JODRELL2: only    15 out of    18 Tsys measurements are on-source
VXSCH: Stations listed above are affected by slewing during Tsys calibration

    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:  11.40  Release 11.4.  March 14, 2015
 
The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog
 
Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).
 
SHORTN: WARNING - Source names longer than 8 characters used.
        This will be a problem if geodetic software (SOLV etc) is used.
        This might be a problem on some correlators.
CHKSCN:    11 scans had more than half the antennas arrive on-source after the start time.
              This could be normal if using duration scheduling with small gaps.
SUMOPE:  Writing summary file bw089.sum
STALST:  WARNING - A station has zero axis offset, which is unlikely.
         Accurate positions, including axis offsets are needed for correlation.
         Is your station location information adequate?
         See the summary file station list to see which stations are suspect.

WRTMSG: Special message from routine VXSCH:
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SEVERE WARNING
You have insufficient gaps in your schedule. Do NOT ignore this message unless
you are sure there will be no media changes or electronic transfer of your
data.
 
The problem is that one or more of your field system controlled
stations has continuous recording for longer than recommended. At
field system stations disk packs can only be changed during gaps in
recording. Also, long continuous recording leads to very large Mark5 files
which are difficult to transfer electronically. Gaps of more than 10 seconds
should be inserted every 22 mins at 2 Gbps (less often at lower rates).  Please
add some gaps to your schedule!  See sched.runlog for a list of affected scans
(may appear well before this message).

    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:  11.40  Release 11.4.  March 14, 2015
 
The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog
 
Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).
 
SHORTN: WARNING - Source names longer than 8 characters used.
        This will be a problem if geodetic software (SOLV etc) is used.
        This might be a problem on some correlators.
 
HARMWARN:  Setup file: band.sx
          There are possible tones in the IF due to mixing of harmonics of the
          VLBA front end synthesizer outputs.  See sched.runlog for detailed information.
 
 
HARMWARN:  Setup file: band.1cm
         This setup also has possible tones from mixing of LO harmonics.
 
 
HARMWARN:  Setup file: band.3mm
         This setup also has possible tones from mixing of LO harmonics.
 
CHKVLBA:  Setup   21 at VLBA_SC .  Channel   5,   2325.-  2341. MHz will be affected
          by strong RFI from Sirius and XM satellite radio between 2320 and 2345 MHz.
CHKVLBA:  Setup   21 at VLBA_SC .  Channel   6,   2325.-  2341. MHz will be affected
          by strong RFI from Sirius and XM satellite radio between 2320 and 2345 MHz.
CHKVLBA:  S band warnings not repeated for other stations using the same setup file.

CHKSFIL: Setup group,  10 in setup file   1 does not have the same sample rate as  other groups in the file.
 
WRTMSG: Special message from routine CHKSFIL:
 
You have sample rates that don't match in different setup groups in
the same setup file.  Normally data recorded under all groups in a
setup file are correlated with each other.  This is impossible with
some correlators and requires special care with others.  With DiFX,
for example, it may be possible to mix sample rates (and bandwidths by
implication) to, for example, correlate several narrow baseband
channels against one wide one.  To do so requires the right relative
frequencies for all basebands and SCHED does not yet check to be sure
the setups are reasonable.  A case where such a mode might be used is
with the VLA at a required 128 MHz baseband bandwidth when it started
doing VLBI being correlated against 32 MHz channels from the RDBE_PFB
systems on the VLBA.  But this should be considered an untested mode
and is not really available for users except on the southern hemisphere
LBA where it is the standard way of incorporating ASKAP.
 
When mixed sample rates, the options to use DOPPLER or FREQ to
adjust the frequency from the schedule rather than the setup file
will be blocked.  Those inputs assume all stations have the same
channel structure which will not be true with mixed sample rates.
 
SFINFO:  **** WARNING ****
    The setup file:/users/cwalker/files/sched_11.4/setups/lba3cm-2p-4IF.set  has unmatched channels at different stations.
    DOPPLER, FREQ, and BW scan inputs will be disabled for this setup.
CHKSCN:    17 scans had more than half the antennas arrive on-source after the start time.
              This could be normal if using duration scheduling with small gaps.
SUMOPE:  Writing summary file lba_mk5.sum
STALST:  WARNING - A station has zero axis offset, which is unlikely.
         Accurate positions, including axis offsets are needed for correlation.
         Is your station location information adequate?
         See the summary file station list to see which stations are suspect.

    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:  11.40  Release 11.4.  March 14, 2015
 
The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog
 
Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).

DEFAULTS: **** Did you intend to mix RDBE and non-RDBE station and frequency files? ****
 
SRFINISH: VEX requested for a schedule with planets.
SRFINISH: That is only allowed if all planet scans are non-recording (eg pointing) scans.
 
HARMWARN:  Setup file: /users/cwalker/files/sched_11.4/setups/pt1cm.set
          There are possible tones in the IF due to mixing of harmonics of the
          VLBA front end synthesizer outputs.  See sched.runlog for detailed information.
 
 
HARMWARN:  Setup file: /users/cwalker/files/sched_11.4/setups/pt24ghz.set
         This setup also has possible tones from mixing of LO harmonics.

         This setup also has possible tones from mixing of LO harmonics.
 
 
CHKSET:  See sched.runlog for information on 2cm frequencies.
WARNING:  See note in sched.runlog about frequency and bandwidth changes.
SUMOPE:  Writing summary file ptg.sum
++++ VEXOUT: Cannot pass accurate positions for planets or satellites in the VEX file.
        For correlation, get the source positions elsewhere - like from ephemeris.
        For VLBA pointing observations as of 2011, the VEX positions
        are not used so this is ok.  You may ignore the warnings from VXSUDT.
VXWRT :  Writing  V E X  file ptg.vex
++++ VXSUDT: WARNING Planetary motion over 0.01 mas/day used.
             VEX file does not describe it.
             Do not use for correlation.
++++ VXSUDT: Planetary motion over 10 arcsec/day specified for source
             JUPITER
             Planetary motion is not implemented in VEX output, but this is too large for pointing
             for more than a short time.
             Be sure to update position adequately often.

    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:  11.40  Release 11.4.  March 14, 2015
 
The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog
 
Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).
 
 
DEFAULTS: **** Did you intend to mix RDBE and non-RDBE station and frequency files? ****
 
SRFINISH: VEX requested for a schedule with planets.
SRFINISH: That is only allowed if all planet scans are non-recording (eg pointing) scans.
 
HARMWARN:  Setup file: /users/cwalker/files/sched_11.4/setups/pt1cm.set
          There are possible tones in the IF due to mixing of harmonics of the
          VLBA front end synthesizer outputs.  See sched.runlog for detailed information.
 
 
HARMWARN:  Setup file: /users/cwalker/files/sched_11.4/setups/pt24ghz.set
         This setup also has possible tones from mixing of LO harmonics.
 
 
HARMWARN:  Setup file: /users/cwalker/files/sched_11.4/setups/pt3mm.set
         This setup also has possible tones from mixing of LO harmonics.
 
 
CHKSET:  See sched.runlog for information on 2cm frequencies.
WARNING:  See note in sched.runlog about frequency and bandwidth changes.
SUMOPE:  Writing summary file ptg2.sum
++++ VEXOUT: Cannot pass accurate positions for planets or satellites in the VEX file.
        For correlation, get the source positions elsewhere - like from ephemeris.
        For VLBA pointing observations as of 2011, the VEX positions
        are not used so this is ok.  You may ignore the warnings from VXSUDT.

WARNING:  See note in sched.runlog about frequency and bandwidth changes.
SUMOPE:  Writing summary file ptg2.sum
PROTECT:  No PT or MK, so will not check that times preemptable for USNO are present.

    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:  11.40  Release 11.4.  March 14, 2015
 
The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog
 
Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).
 
STREAD: ==== WARNING ==== Mark5A specified for a VLBA  station.
        Those recorders have been removed from most VLBA stations.
SRFINISH: VEX requested for a schedule with satellites.
SRFINISH: That is only allowed if all satellite scans are non-recording (eg pointing) scans.
SETBAND:  Both BAND and adequate information  to set frequencies were provided
          BAND will be ignored.  Only one warning will be issued.
          Setup file: egsat.set
CHKSC1:  Trying to use ephmeris and satellites in the same schedule
CHKSC1:  That might cause a crash that looks like an inability to read a bsp file.
CHKSCN:  **** WARNING ****
    This schedule contains scans for which SOURCE and DOPSRC are different and
    are both line sources.  Is this intentional?
CHKSCN:    18 scans had more than half the antennas arrive on-source after the start time.
              This could be normal if using duration scheduling with small gaps.
SUMOPE:  Writing summary file egsat.sum
++++ VEXOUT: Cannot pass accurate positions for planets or satellites in the VEX file.
        For correlation, get the source positions elsewhere - like from ephemeris.
        For VLBA pointing observations as of 2011, the VEX positions
        are not used so this is ok.  You may ignore the warnings from VXSUDT.
VXWRT :  Writing  V E X  file egsat.vex
++++ VXSUDT: WARNING Planetary motion over 0.01 mas/day used.
             VEX file does not describe it.
             Do not use for correlation.
++++ VXSUDT: Planetary motion over 10 arcsec/day specified for source
             MARS
             Planetary motion is not implemented in VEX output, but this is too large for pointing
             for more than a short time.
             Be sure to update position adequately often.
++++ VXSUDT: WARNING Planetary motion over 0.01 mas/day used.
             VEX file does not describe it.
             Do not use for correlation.
++++ VXSUDT: Planetary motion over 10 arcsec/day specified for source
             MER-B
             Planetary motion is not implemented in VEX output, but this is too large for pointing
             for more than a short time.
             Be sure to update position adequately often.
